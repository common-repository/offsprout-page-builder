= What Is the Offsprout Page Builder? =

Simply put, Offsprout is the first WordPress page builder built specifically for design agencies and freelancers. And it is white-labeled out of the box.

While every other page builder focuses on being the best tool for a non-technical person to build their own website, Offsprout's sole focus is helping design agencies and freelancers rapidly build and manage client sites.

*   Complex row/section backgrounds with images, gradients, image screens, and videos.

2. After activating Offsprout, navigate to the settings page at Settings > Page Builder to configure the post types you would like it to work with.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How is Offsprout better than other page builders for design agencies and freelancers? =
Having come from the agency world ourselves, we know the tasks that take a long time. Offsprout focuses on centralizing design and reuse of design elements, so that sites have better design consistency and can be updated throughout with minimal effort. As just one example, Offsprout allows you to design multiple button skins that can be re-used throughout your site.

= Can I white-label Offsprout? =
Offsprout comes with zero branding right out of the gate. We don't want to come between you and your clients!
